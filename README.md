Dice lingo: XdY means X dice with Y sides each.
E.g, 3d6 means three six-sided dice. 2d10 means two ten-sided dice.

How to play Dice Farmer:

Each player starts with 3d6. You win by getting 3d20.

Each turn, roll all dice. Remove all dice with 1's rolled; they are dead.
These dice are no longer part of your pool.

Sort the remaining dice to form groups that add up to exactly 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, or 20.
Add dice to your pool according to these groups.

Groups may have only 1 die. (E.g, a 6 can become a d6 by itself)

You get your initial dice back as well, except the ones that rolled 1's.

If you are reduced to zero dice, you start again at 3d6.

Ignore the remainders.
